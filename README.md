## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Video Analysis
Simply paste a YouTube URL. Our engine scans the metadata and frames to understand the core narrative, ensuring your thumbnails are contextually perfect.

### 🎭 Dual-Mode Generation
*   **Normal Mode**: Professional, branded, and clean designs.
*   **Clickbait Mode**: High-emotion, high-contrast designs optimized for maximum CTR and emotional engagement.

### 📐 Vertical Sync (16:9 & 9:16)
Generate a widescreen thumbnail and a perfectly coordinated **9:16 vertical version** for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels in one click.

### 🪄 Magic Editor
Don't like a specific detail? Use our natural language editor. Tell the AI to *"Add fire effects,"* *"Make the text bigger,"* or *"Change the background to a sunset,"* and watch it happen in real-time.

### 🔒 Privacy-First Persistence
Your projects stay on your device. We use **High-Efficiency Smart Compression** to store your history in local storage, ensuring your work persists across reloads without ever hitting our servers.
